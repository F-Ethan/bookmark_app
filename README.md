Bookmark: Bible Reading Tracker for Grant Horner's System

A simple, intuitive Flutter app designed to help readers stay consistent with Professor Grant Horner's Bible-Reading System (also known as "The Ten Lists Bible Reading System"). This plan challenges you to read 10 chapters a day from 10 distinct lists, cycling through the entire Bible multiple times a year without commentary‚Äîjust pure Scripture to deepen your engagement with God's Word.
Whether you're a first-time user or a veteran of the system, Bookmark makes tracking your progress effortless. Set your start date, log daily readings, and pick up right where you left off.
Features

User Setup: Enter your name, starting day, and date to personalize your journey.
Daily Tracking: Advance through the 10 lists (e.g., Gospels, Pentateuch, Psalms, etc.) with one-tap updates for your current day.
Persistent Storage: All progress saved locally using SharedPreferences‚Äîyour data stays secure and accessible across sessions.
Settings Screen: Quick access to view or reset your user info and current progress.
Clean, Minimal UI: Built with Flutter for smooth performance on iOS (and Android in future updates).
Offline-First: No internet required; focus on reading, not connectivity.

The app follows the core of Horner's system: Read one chapter from each list daily, looping back to the start when a list ends. For example:

List 1: Gospels, Acts, Epistles
List 2: Pentateuch
... (up to List 10: Revelation, etc.)

(Full list details are printed on the app's onboarding screen or can be found in Horner's original PDF guide.)
